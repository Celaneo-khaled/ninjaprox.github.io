I'm Vinh Nguyen, a generalist and iOS specialist.

Here you find things I learn and share with others by writting.

Topics I concern include mobile development, UI/UX, application architecture, working methodology and entrepreneur, but are not limited just so.

I'm curious about human behavior and reads about psychology when technology gets too boring for me. LEGO is always his favorite toy and photography is my new friend.
